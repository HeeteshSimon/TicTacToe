# TicTacToe
The game which we play whenever we feel like passing the time. <br>
The game of X's and 0's.
## Python
Used a lot functions do make sure the game follows its genuine nature. A pretty easy and amazing project. <br>
I learnt how to do it without the **pygame** module otherwise the game whould have a separate GUI. Maybe I'll do it next time!
